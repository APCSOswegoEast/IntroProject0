Using computer code to make art?
It’s possible! Processing is a
text-based coding platform for
artists, designers and hobbyists to
create their own visual software
programs.

STEP 1: Opening Processing
Once you have downloaded and unzipped the Processing folder, open it and you will find the
Processing logo. Double click on it and it will launch Processing!


STEP 2: The IDE
Once Processing launches you will see the IDE (Integrated Development Environment)
window. It should look like this. It has a text area in the middle, a play and stop button at the
top, and a terminal window at the bottom. For now you should only really care about the
play/stop and the text window.\

STEP 3: Setup
You can click in the text area to start typing; it works just like any other text editor. Now
we are going to get started coding! The first thing we have to do is write some setup
code. Setup code is like building roads for the computer to follow - if I gave you
directions without any roads, you wouldn't be able to get anywhere! We create setup
code by typing the following into the text editor. The void setup()starts the setup
code, and will run whatever code is in between the curly brackets { }. In this case it is
the size() function, which dictates the size of our program window in pixels. This
window will be 200 pixels x 200 pixels. Your setup code will only run once at the
beginning of your program and then the computer moves on to your draw() code.\

STEP 4: Syntax
Do you notice the semicolon (;) at the end of the draw function? That tells the computer
that it has reached the end of an instruction and to go to the next line. If that isn't there
we end up getting an error. The same holds true with the parentheses and commas, and
all functions are case sensitive.

STEP 5: What Function?
A great way to find out the correct syntax and use for a function is to use the
reference tool. You can find it by highlighting a function like size and right
clicking on it. You can then click on “Find in Reference” from the drop-down
menu. You can also click here for the [reference page](https://processing.org/reference/) on the Processing website.
This webpage is helpful because it gives you example code, proper syntax, and
the parameters you need to give the function in order for it to work.\

STEP 6: Draw
The second part of the sketch is the draw()code. This code is run over and over at 30
times a second! This is where we usually put all of the code we use to create something
visual. First, we are going to draw a line. We use the line()function as seen and we add
four numbers. These numbers are the x and y coordinates for the ends of the line. (0,0) is the
upper left hand corner of the window and (200,200) is the lower right hand corner of the
window. For a great reference on the coordinate system for Processing, [click here](https://processing.org/tutorials/drawing/).\

STEP 7: Play!
Once your code window looks like this, hit the play button. What do you see?
Your window should look something like below. A grey background with a line
going from the upper left hand corner to the lower right hand corner.
Congratulations on your first Processing Sketch!\

STEP 8: Share your work!
If you would like to share your work (which you do), you can sign up at
 [openprocessing.org](https://openprocessing.org). Open Processing allows you to share your code and view the
drawing online, and allows others to fork or borrow your code to manipulate and change it
on their own while still keeping your sketch intact for others to check out.


TAKING IT FURTHER

● What other geometry could we draw using Processing? (Hint: Reference!)
● Draw a second line going from the upper right corner to the lower left corner.
● Change the size of your window!
